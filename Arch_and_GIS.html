            </div>
            <p> <b>I have broad interests in Archaeology. Generally, in Anthropology I am interested in egalitarian
                    lifeways, third genders globally, community engagement and community informed action. As
                    anthropology is a discipline that was born out of and sought to justify colonialism, I find it
                    important to fight against the neo-colonial influences on the discipline currently. As a white
                    archaeologist, I plan to follow the lead of archaeologists of color, and activists from involved
                    communities. In relation to this I am interested in Historical Archaeology, specifically shedding
                    light on the lives of Indigenous, Black and other marginalized peoples in American history.
                    Theoretically, I am interested in Marxist Archaeology, and I seek to think of all kinds of people
                    from the past. This can be done by studying the archaeology of households and labor. I want to use
                    the web development skills I have gained to create accessible, scholarly archaeological knowledge
                    for the public. <br>
                    I am very excited to work in the field, as not only do I love archaeology, but I love being outside.
                    I found myself on hikes, sitting on the ground and running my hands through the dirt. So why not be
                    paid to shovel! In addition to the field, I look forward to working in the lab. Be it artifact
                    analysis, geochemical testing, or research for reports.

                <p>My career goals are to become a professional archaeologist. I am interested in both cultural resource
                    management and working within the federal government. I am currently enrolled in UNM on track to
                    gain a
                    BS with a focus on archaeology. After graduation I would like to work for one field season and gain
                    practical archeology experience and then go to graduate school to get a master’s degree. </p>

                <p><b>Research Experience</b></p>
                <p>Current Research – I am currently working on a research project about Ancestral Puebloan agricultural
                    features in New Mexico. This project is using data from the UNM 1990 Field School and the UNM Office
                    of
                    Contract Archaeology. I will be creating a geospatial database, mapping features, and performing
                    spatial
                    analysis to understand the hydrology of these features. I am working with Dr. W.H. Wills. </p>

                <p>2021 – Through the UNM Intro to GIS course under Dr. Caitlin Lippitt, I took part in an urban tree
                    study.
                    My part in this study focused on a three-block study area in the residential part of Nob Hill,
                    Albuquerque. I took photos of the non-cultivated vegetation within the study area and monitored it
                    over
                    the semester. Ultimately, all of the trees in the study area were digitally mapped, this added to
                    the
                    class’s overall understanding of Albuquerque’s urban canopy. </p>

                <p>2017 – The UNT Anthropology Field Methods class created and took part in a research project that
                    gained
                    and presented community input to the city of Denton, Texas in anticipation for the cities new plan
                    and
                    budget.
                    This research was advised by Dr. Andrew Nelson and done in partnership with the city of Denton. In
                    participation with this research, I observed a study area, surveyed stakeholders within that area,
                    interviewed multiple residents of the area, analyzed data, wrote a report of findings and presented
                    those findings.
                </p>

                <p>2014 – As part of an undergraduate course focused on applied and activist anthropology I took part in
                    a
                    research project on human trafficking awareness in Denton, Texas.
                    The research was advised by Dr. Mariela Nuñez-Janes and worked in partnership with a local
                    non-profit
                    ODIS (Opening Doors International Services). This research included working with multiple
                    stakeholders,
                    creating a research plan, conducting surveys, conducting interviews, data analysis, report
                    presentation
                    and the writing of a report.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Work Experience</b></p>
                <p>In the three years while I was not in an academic setting, I worked two different jobs in which I
                    gained
                    many practical skills. </p>
                <p>2018-2020 Directing Manager: Maison Blanche Paint Company
                    MBPC was a very small company in which I assisted the owner in day to day and big picture
                    operations.
                    Within this company I gained skills in project management, communication with clients and
                    manufacturers
                    and budgeting.
                </p>
                <p>2017-2018 Assistant General Manager: Rusty Tacos
                    While working as the AGM at Rusty Tacos I gained skills in managing a team of people, communicating
                    with
                    customers, and working within legal regulations.
