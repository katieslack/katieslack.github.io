                        <p>My interests began in GIScience when I saw the broad applications and unique communication
                            abilities of geovisualization. I am passionate about open science and favor open source
                            technology. <br>I believe open science goes in tandem with community science and making
                            science
                            as

                            My interests in climate change are related to my personal philosphy of love and respect of
                            nature, animals and other people. Climate change is already impacts peoples across the
                            globe, the impacts disproportiantely impact marginalized communities. Using geovisualization
                            to understand climate change impacts and adaptation impacts I hope to highlight geographic
                            areas that need investment to face these impacts. Additionally, I seek to make this
                            knowledge easily accessible through an web application focused on user experience.
                            <br>
                            I believe political ecology, critical physcial geography, and more than human geographies
                            can be employed as frameworks for understanding climate change while framing environmental
                            justice.

                    policymakers and stakeholders to mitigate climate-change related adversity. I am interested in the

                    I want to use visualize the impacts of different climate change adaptation techniquese. GIScience
                    technology, empowered with geovisualization and AI, is invaluable to help people adapt as the

                    <!-- <p> <b>2021:</b> I performed a spatial analysis project evaluating the hydrology of a mesa top in
                        Central
                        New
                        Mexico. The mesa contains the archaeological remnants of dry farming fields cultivated by
                        Ancestral
                        Puebloan people. I visually located the fields on aerial footage and created a map. Using
                        ArcGIS's
                        Spatial Analysis tools I created watersheds out of the ephemeral arroyos and overlaid these
                        above
                        field polygons. This modeled how water would have run over the fields before running off the
                        mesa.
                        To simulate the amount of sunlight the fields received I created three Hillshade rasters that
                        represented the sun in the morning, noon and afternoon. The model did not use paleoenvironmental
                        data.
                        To take the research further a map of the arroyos would need to be made at the time of
                        occupation.
                        Archaeological presence of check dams or other agricultural techniques would need to be taken
                        into
                        consideration.

                    <!-- <p>2021 â€“ Through the UNM Intro to GIS course under Dr. Caitlin Lippitt, I took part in an urban

                        study.
                        My part in this study focused on a three-block study area in the residential part of Nob Hill,
                        Albuquerque. I took photos of the non-cultivated vegetation within the study area and monitored
                        it
                        over
                        the semester. Ultimately, all of the trees in the study area were digitally mapped, this added
                        to
                        the
                        classâ€™s overall understanding of Albuquerqueâ€™s urban canopy. </p> -->
