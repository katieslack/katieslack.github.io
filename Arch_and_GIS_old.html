                    When I began in Geographic Information Science I was amazed at the broad applications and unique
                    abilities of geovisualization. I want to use GIS to address climate change related adversities, from
                    a social science perspective. I am also interested in using web mapping to create interactive
                    interfaces for educational purposes.

                <p><b>Personal Statement</b></p>
                <p>My desired long-term professional goals are to create data-driven geographic models that inform
                    policymakers and stakeholders to mitigate climate-change related adversity. I am interested in the
                    social threats of climate change which disproportionately affects marginalized people. GIScience
                    technology, empowered with geovisualization and AI, is invaluable to help people adapt as the
                    Earth’s climate changes.</p>

                    <p><b>Research Experience</b></p>
                    <p>Current Research – I am currently a part of the GeoAIR Lab (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence
                        Research and Visualization Laboratory) and Dr.Liping Yang. Learn more about the lab <a
                            href="https://geoair.lipingyang.org/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
                    <p>
                        2022 - In Dr. Liping Yang's Internet Mapping course I led a team that developed an interactive
                        web map showing riparian vegetation along the Northern Rio Grande corridor. The application can
                        be found <a href="https://katieslack.github.io/MyWebApp.html">here.</a> A video introduction and
                        explanation of the application can be found <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP7NYNFE9U0">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p> 2021 - I performed a spatial analysis project evaluating the hydrology of a mesa top in Central
                        New
                        Mexico. The mesa contains the archaeological remnants of dry farming fields cultivated by
                        Ancestral
                        Puebloan people. I visually located the fields on aerial footage and created a map. Using
                        ArcGIS's
                        Spatial Analysis tools I created watersheds out of the ephemeral arroyos and overlaid these
                        above
                        field polygons. This modeled how water would have run over the fields before running off the
                        mesa.
                        To simulate the amount of sunlight the fields received I created three Hillshade rasters that
                        represented the sun in the morning, noon and afternoon. The model did not use paleoenvironmental
                        data.
                        To take the research further a map of the arroyos would need to be made at the time of
                        occupation.
                        Archaeological presence of check dams or other agricultural techniques would need to be taken
                        into
                        consideration.

                    </p>
                    <p>2021 – Through the UNM Intro to GIS course under Dr. Caitlin Lippitt, I took part in an urban
                        tree
                        study.
                        My part in this study focused on a three-block study area in the residential part of Nob Hill,
                        Albuquerque. I took photos of the non-cultivated vegetation within the study area and monitored
                        it
                        over
                        the semester. Ultimately, all of the trees in the study area were digitally mapped, this added
                        to
                        the
                        class’s overall understanding of Albuquerque’s urban canopy. </p>

                    <p>2017 – The UNT Anthropology Field Methods class created and took part in a research project that
                        gained
                        and presented community input to the city of Denton, Texas in anticipation for the cities new
                        plan
                        and
                        budget.
                        This research was advised by Dr. Andrew Nelson and done in partnership with the city of Denton.
                        In
                        participation with this research, I observed a study area, surveyed stakeholders within that
                        area,
                        interviewed multiple residents of the area, analyzed data, wrote a report of findings and
                        presented
                        those findings.
                    </p>

                    <p>2014 – As part of an undergraduate course focused on applied and activist anthropology I took
                        part in
                        a
                        research project on human trafficking awareness in Denton, Texas.
                        The research was advised by Dr. Mariela Nuñez-Janes and worked in partnership with a local
                        non-profit
                        ODIS (Opening Doors International Services). This research included working with multiple
                        stakeholders,
                        creating a research plan, conducting surveys, conducting interviews, data analysis, report
                        presentation
                        and the writing of a report.

                        Within this company I gained skills in project management, communication with clients and
                        manufacturers
