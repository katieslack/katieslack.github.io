## Issues with putting the map into our container. 

## Week of April 11 - April 18th
Katie: Issues displaying map within leaflet-timeline-slider.... folder. This is slowly but surely coming along. Right now some geojson points are being read in and a timeline is displayed.
4-12 Got the basemap showing. Need to integrate the getDataAddMarkers (geojson points) and the filter function (timeline) together.
